## Tank Kwan Do

* Skyler Hanson (swh65)
* Kyler Carling (kjc472)
* Robert Bednarek (rab587)

## Instructions

In Tank Kwan Do, you face off against another player in close-quarters Tank combat. Players 1 and 2 control their respective tanks with WASD/Arrows, and have three moves:

-Harpoon (SPACE/SHIFT): Can be used to attach to the other player or to the crates scattered about the map.

-Boxing Glove (Q/ENTER): Can be fired off to knock back opponents or objects.

-Anchor (E/CTRL): Makes it harder for a player to be pushed or dragged around, but disables weapons while in use.

Players attempt to knock one another into the mud surrounding the arena, and win after eliminating all of their opponent's lives.

## Known Bugs or Issues

A player that dies while their harpoon is attached to the other player will not have their harpoon reset until they use their anchor (E/CTRL).

The tank sprite is snapped back to facing up during the death/fall animation, regardless of the player's actual angle on death.
